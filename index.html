<br>
Maqam.tv is an itinerant broadcasting channel airing video content from mainly North to Central Africa and South to Central Asia online and offline. The term broadcasting is taken in its two senses here: for one thing, it’s a matter of communicating a given content. And for the other, it’s a matter of sowing seeds in a given area <i>by hand</i> –and so: the back is to the breeze, the walk is slow-paced, the casting is measured. 
<br>
<br>Maqam.tv holds hoards of joy within! Yet anger too. It gets its tender force from gestures of liberation, resistance, reparation and healing. And grew from the urgency in contesting archiving protocols and in highjacking broadcasting frequencies. It wishes for a redressing. And thus, it stands. 
<img id="min" img src="images/min.png">
<!-- Maqam widens toward a plethora of knowledge, cultural and art practices to tell stories; sometimes to tell them for the first time, sometimes to re-narrate them, sometimes to put them back into circulation. That is for soils to be demined, for thoughts to be traced back and for blueprints to be mapped out.
It just loves errancy and strives in the rearranging of landscapes and bodies, languages and tales, vibrations and patterns.  -->
<div class="title">inquiries</div>
<br>
<br>Maqam.tv has several online and offline conducts, where it expands on a film language developped from and around the format of the excerpt, or the segment, or the passage, or the snippet. It's a format that breaks open, that pollenizes, that engenders. It cultivates the ungrammatical, the cripling and the fortunate. Favors the no-longer-is, the almost-was, the not-yet and the soon-to.
<br>
<br>
Maqam.tv thinks of itself as a living, porous, archival station. The non-authoritarian, non-immortal, non-sanitarian type of archive that likes to undertake in sabotage acts against its very self. That’s because it does not much believe in the alleged absoluteness, timelessness and neutrality of the archival object. Maqam.tv’s archival spaces are thus the organic and vulnerable sites for the transmission of the other organic and vulnerable recollections and imaginations of individuals and collectives. It is uncertain and incomplete. Probably unreliable too. And can be negotiable any time.
<br>
<br>
Offline, Maqam.tv regularly collaborates with individuals, cultural institutions and nonprofits, hosting screenings (of excerpts or full-length formats), talks and workshops in movie theaters, art spaces, outdoor areas and classrooms. 
<br>And then online, Maqam.tv invests its own domaine and that of others with varying curriculums. Mainly, its virtual applications wish to endanger the fortified cellars of information. They find inspiration in cyberpunk practices, and other discontented and non-compliant virtual exercises that reclaim back the flowing, streaming or torrential character of information access on the internet. Maqam.tv's online components call for a reconsideration of the fabrication and dissemination of knowledge on the internet. 
<br><br>For now, Maqam.tv has three programs ongoing: <i>instagram</i>, <i>research cycles</i> and <i> transmission</i>. 
<br>
<br>
<div class="title">instagram</div>
<br>
<br>
For years, Maqam.tv has been investing Instagram as a curatorial platform (<a class="general" href="https://www.instagram.com/maqam.tv/" target="_blank">instagram.com/maqam.tv</a>) following a methodology focused on broadcasting unanchored, seemingly unrelated, audiovisual pieces, for <i>some thing</i> to flourish from the cracks.
<!-- . For echoes to resonate against each other, for cracks to converge or for waves to carry one toward, and away from, another. -->
<br>
<br>
<div class="title">research cycles</div>
<br>
<br>Maqam.tv’s research cycles are programs sketching out lines of enquiry to be freely answered through different conversation, story-telling and transmission practices. They function a little like stages —for mainly video screenings, but also sonic, visual and text-based exercises, live acts and discussions. And their aim is to unpack the stakes of one central theme in the most unimpeded ways.
<br>
<br>The cycles are spaces in which stable and incarcerated research frameworks can be disavowed by way of commoning; co-creating, co-teaching and co-organizing, all through ever-changing bodies and formulas. They are unanchored, transmigratory even: they pass from a state to another, from a body to another, from a place to another; and they’re certainly not on a rush. They take their time, stretch over months, sometimes do not have a determined ending, and sometimes again overlap. A cycle develops a little like a jazz chorus actually, with preliminaries, or series of improvised, free, segments after each melodic part that elevate the register little by little, until reaching its climax.
<br>The ongoing research cycle is <i>Le corps par dessus l'image</i>, find more information here.
<br>
<br>
<div class="title">transmission</div>
<br>
<br>This one comes as the arrogant, cheeky, self-centered younger sibling. It does not care too much about defending a given thesis. It is mostly here for the fun. And because it is so inclined to act on impulse, it won’t wait long before getting out there. It’ll be showing up here and there, will try its best to stick to timetables, will probably end up not so much doing so. 
<br>
<br>maqamtv.com/transmission is a space for broadcasting, it only goes live during evenings and for a limited amount of time, from 8p.m. to 10p.m. It looks a lot like channel surfing; it’s groovy and upbeat, scanning in the most straightforward and unambivalent ways content relating to one subject. It draws inspiration from early time variety shows, itself based on 19th century French Vaudeville, and from 90s-00s late-night tv programs that served as the unconfined platforms for the freest audio-visual expression. Sometimes, the broadcasts travel outside of its dedicated online space, but that just depends on thematics and encounters.
