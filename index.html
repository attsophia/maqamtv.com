<div class="title">opening act</div>
<br>
<br>
Maqam.tv is an itinerant broadcasting channel airing video material from mainly North to Central Africa and South to Central Asia online and offline. The term broadcasting is taken in its two senses here: for one thing, it’s a matter of communicating a given content. And for the other, it’s a matter of sowing seeds in a given area <i>by hand</i> –and so: the back is to the breeze, the walk is slow-paced, the casting is measured. 
<br>
<br>Maqam.tv holds hoards of joy within! Yet anger too. It gets its tender force from gestures of liberation, resistance, reparation and healing. And grew from the urgency in contesting archiving protocols and in highjacking broadcasting frequencies. It wishes for a redressing. And thus, it stands. 
<img id="min" img src="images/min.png">
<!-- Maqam widens toward a plethora of knowledge, cultural and art practices to tell stories; sometimes to tell them for the first time, sometimes to re-narrate them, sometimes to put them back into circulation. That is for soils to be demined, for thoughts to be traced back and for blueprints to be mapped out.
It just loves errancy and strives in the rearranging of landscapes and bodies, languages and tales, vibrations and patterns.  -->
<div class="title">inquiries</div>
<br>
<br>Maqam.tv has several online and offline conducts, where it expands on a cinematic language developped from and around the format of the excerpt, or the segment, or the passage, or the sample. It's a format that breaks open, that pollenizes, that engenders. It <!-- cultivates the ungrammatical, the cripling and the fortunate. --> considers the no-longer-is, the almost-was, the not-yet and the soon-to. It's a language of hope.
<br>
<br>
Maqam.tv thinks of itself as a living, porous, archival station. The non-authoritarian, non-immortal, non-sanitarian type of archive that likes to undertake in sabotage acts against its very self. That’s because it does not much believe in the alleged absoluteness of the archival object. Maqam.tv’s archival spaces are thus the organic and vulnerable sites for the transmission of the other organic and vulnerable recollections and imaginations of individuals and collectives. It is uncertain and incomplete. Probably unreliable too. And can be negotiable any time.
<br>
<br>
Offline, Maqam.tv regularly collaborates with individuals, cultural institutions and nonprofits, hosting screenings (of excerpts or full-length formats), talks and workshops in movie theaters, art spaces, outdoor areas and classrooms. 
<br>And then online, Maqam.tv invests its own domaines and that of others with varying curriculums. Regardless, its virtual applications wish to endanger the fortified cellars of information. They find inspiration in cyberpunk practices, and other discontented and non-compliant virtual exercises that reclaim back the flowing, streaming or torrential character of knowledge access on the internet. Maqam.tv's online components call for a reconsideration of the fabrication and dissemination of knowledge on the internet. 
<br><br>Beside its regular physical screening sessions, for now, Maqam.tv has three programs ongoing: <i>instagram</i>, <i>research cycles</i> and <i> transmission</i>. 
Generally, Maqam.tv is focused on following a pace that sits outside of the one imposed by dissociated, extractivist, overflowing modes of production, dissemination and engagement. It is more interested in following the lead of the pond, or the fungi, or the ant and their teachings in emergence, entanglement, regeneration and decay.
<br>
<br>
<div class="title">instagram</div>
<br>
<br>
For years, Maqam.tv has been investing Instagram as a curatorial platform (<a class="general" href="https://www.instagram.com/maqam.tv/" target="_blank">instagram.com/maqam.tv</a>) following a cut:collaged:captioned methodology and focused on broadcasting audiovisual pieces for <i>some thing</i> to flourish from the cracks. And perhaps you trip over one of those outgrows in your errancy?   <!-- Image tracks are sensibly composed from an Instagram post to another, and from within single posts. 

	hopefully, to modified understandings of cinematic production, subject and spectatorship. -->
<!-- . For echoes to resonate against each other, for cracks to converge or for waves to carry one toward, and away from, another. -->
<br>
<br>
<div class="title">research cycles</div>
<br>
<br>Maqam.tv’s research cycles are programs sketching out lines of enquiry to be answered through different expression and transmission practices. They are stages for video screenings to which are often added audio, visual, performative or text-based acts. And their aim is to unpack the stakes of one central theme in a deep, free and experimental way.
<br>
<br>The cycles are spaces in which stable and incarcerated research frameworks can be disavowed by way of commoning; co-creating, co-teaching and co-organizing, all through ever-changing bodies and formulas. They are unanchored, transmigratory even: they pass from a state to another, from a body to another, from a place to another; and they’re certainly not on a rush. They take their time, stretch over months, sometimes do not have a determined ending, and sometimes again overlap. A cycle develops a little like a jazz chorus actually, with preliminaries, or series of improvised, free, segments after each melodic part that elevate the register little by little, until reaching its promised climax.

<div class="title">transmission</div>
<br>
<br>This one comes as the arrogant, cheeky, self-centered younger sibling. It does not care too much about defending a given thesis in elaborate fashion. It is mostly here for the fun. 
<br>
<br><a class="general" href="https://maqamtv.com/transmission" target="_blank">maqamtv.com/transmission</a> is a space for lengthy video broadcasting and slow viewing. It moves from a place of impulse and draws inspiration from contestational and anti-establishment strategies for image making and dissemination. But it really is as simple as just a space not too concerned with intelligibility were images come one after the other for sensible and mindful viewing. Sometimes, the broadcasts travel outside of their dedicated online space for augmented viewing experiences.
