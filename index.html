Maqam.tv is an itinerant broadcasting channel airing video content from parts of Africa and Asia online and offline. The term broadcasting is taken in its two senses here: for one thing, it’s a matter of communicating a given content. And for the other, it’s a matter of sowing seeds in a given area <i>by hand</i> –and so: the back is to the breeze, the walk is slow-paced, the casting is measured. 
<br>Maqam holds hoards of joy within! Yet anger too. Because so much of that material remains unheard of and so many voices are yet to be elevated. It wishes for a redressing. And thus, it stands. 
<br><img id="min" img src="images/min.png">
Maqam widens towards a plethora of knowledge, cultural and art practices to tell stories; sometimes to tell them for the first time, sometimes to re-narrate them, sometimes to put them back into circulation. It does love agitation; strives in the rearranging of landscapes and bodies, languages and tales, vibrations and patterns. It gets its force from theories and practices of liberation, restoration and healing. And grew from the very urgency in decentralizing archiving and transmission processes and highjacking broadcasting frequencies. 
That is for soils to be demined. For thoughts to be retrieved, memories; restored. 
<br>
Maqam.tv has already a strong digital existence; for years, it has been investing Instagram as a curatorial platform following a methodology focused on bringing people of different outlooks together around quasi-exclusive video content (<a class="general" href="https://www.instagram.com/maqam.tv/" target="_blank">instagram.com/maqam.tv</a>). And it does have a growing existence offline too: it has been collaborating with cultural institutions and nonprofits, hosting screenings, talks and round tables relevant to their area of study or interest in movie theaters, art spaces, outdoor areas, classrooms —anywhere really where people can get comfortable watching a film and sharing thoughts.
<br>
<div id="title-text2">coming soon on maqamtv.com</div>
<br><br>Maqam’s soon-to-be launched online platform functions as a living, porous, archival station. The non-authoritarian, non-immortal, non-sanitarian type of archive that likes to undertake in sabotage acts against its very self. That’s because it does not much believe in its alleged absolute universality and timelessness. And mistrusts any declination claiming neutrality. Maqam’s online archival space is thus one organic and vulnerable site for the transmission of the other organic and vulnerable recollections and imaginations of individuals. It is uncertain and incomplete. Probably unreliable too. And can be negotiable any time. 
<br>
Maqam’s virtual application wishes to endanger the fortified cellars of information; it finds inspiration in cyberpunk practices, and other discontented and non-compliant virtual exercises that reclaim back the flowing, streaming or torrential character of information access on the internet. Its online declinations call for a reconsideration of the fabrication and dissemination of knowledge on the internet. 
<br>For now, two programs are to be launched on maqamtv.com: the <i>research cycles</i> and the <i>live transmission</i>. 
<br><div id="title-text3">maqamtv.com: research cycles</div>
<br>
<br>Maqam’s research cycles are programs sketching out lines of enquiry to be freely answered through different knowledge and story-telling practices. They function a little like stages —for mainly video screenings, but also sonic, visual and text-based exercises; live acts and conversations. And their aim is to unpack the stakes of one central theme in the most extensive and unimpeded ways.
<br>The cycles are to be housed in the virtual space of maqamtv.com and their content is to be viewed free of charge. They are spaces in which story-telling modalities can be explored collectively by way of co-curation, co-development and co-production, all through ever-changing teams, or collaborators (authors, artists, curators), and partners (institutions, organizations, funding agencies). 
<br>The research cycles are unanchored, transmigratory even: they pass from a state to another, from a body to another, from a place to another; and they’re certainly not on a rush. They take their time, stretch over months, sometimes do not have a determined ending, and sometimes again overlap. A cycle develops a little like a jazz chorus actually, with preliminaries, or series of improvised, free, segments after each melodic part that elevate the register little by little, until reaching its climax. 
<br>
<div id="title-text3">maqamtv.com: live transmission</div>
<br><br>This one comes as the arrogant, cheeky, self-centered younger sibling. It does not care too much about defending a given thesis. It is mostly here for the fun. And because it is so inclined to act on impulse, it won’t wait long before getting out there. It’ll be showing up here and there, will try its best to stick to timetables, will probably end up not so much doing so. live.maqamtv.com is a space for live broadcasting, it only goes live during evenings and for a limited amount of time, from 8p.m. to 10p.m. It looks a lot like channel surfing; it’s groovy and upbeat, scanning in the most straightforward and unambivalent ways content relating to one subject. It draws inspiration from early time variety shows, itself based on 19th century French Vaudeville and from 90s-00s late-night tv programs that served as the unconfined platforms for the freest audio-visual expression.
