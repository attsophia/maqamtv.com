		<br>Maqam.tv’s research cycles are programs sketching out lines of enquiry to be freely answered through different expression, story-telling and transmission practices. They function a little like stages —for mainly video screenings, but also sonic, visual and text-based exercises, live acts and conversations. And their aim is to unpack the stakes of one central theme in the most unimpeded ways.
<br>
<br>The cycles are spaces in which stable and incarcerated research frameworks can be disavowed by way of commoning; co-creating, co-teaching and co-organizing, all through ever-changing bodies and formulas. They are unanchored, transmigratory even: they pass from a state to another, from a body to another, from a place to another; and they’re certainly not on a rush. They take their time, stretch over months, sometimes do not have a determined ending, and sometimes again overlap. A cycle develops a little like a jazz chorus actually, with preliminaries, or series of improvised, free, segments after each melodic part that elevate the register little by little, until reaching its climax.
