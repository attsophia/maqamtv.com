		<br>Maqam.tv’s research cycles are programs sketching out lines of enquiry to be answered through different expression and transmission practices. They function a little like stages for video screenings to which are often added audio, visual, performative or text-based acts. And their aim is to unpack the stakes of one central theme in a deep, free and experimental way.
<br>
<br>The cycles are spaces in which stable and incarcerated research frameworks can be disavowed by way of commoning; co-creating, co-teaching and co-organizing, all through ever-changing bodies and formulas. They are unanchored, transmigratory even: they pass from a state to another, from a body to another, from a place to another; and they’re certainly not on a rush. They take their time, stretch over months, sometimes do not have a determined ending, and sometimes again overlap. A cycle develops a little like a jazz chorus actually, with preliminaries, or series of improvised, free, segments after each melodic part that elevate the register little by little, until reaching its climax.

		<br>
		<i>Le corps par dessus l’image</i> is a research cycle exploring ways of taking up space with one’s body before and behind; around and against; ahead and after; afar and over the moving image. It’s interested in having the image speak in tongues it doesn’t know of and in playing light of common spectatorship and viewing experiences. The cycle takes cue of figures of narrators, griots, story-tellers and other mediators and has until now taken the forms of pedagogical workshops, written pieces, mise-en-scènes, performances, and book making ateliers.

<i>ma fawqa al-sura</i> is a workshop about mediating films as to translate, elevate, unscreen, shuffle around or upset their appartus. The workshop culminated in a one-hour mise-en-scène where participants played in and out their selection of four short films, revised scenarios, enacted film protagonists and film crews and just generally had a lot of fun.

		<blockquote><b>various stages of unheard</b>, lecture-performance with a screening of <i>La Nouba des Femmes du Mont Chenoua</i> by Assia Djebar (1977)
<br>Tashweesh Festival with Beursschouwburg · October 2022, Brussels, Belgium
		<br>
		<br>
<i>various stages of unheard</i> is a lecture-performance expanding on the context of production and reception of <i>La Nouba des Femmes du Mont Chenoua</i> and reviewing ways by which the instrumentalization of women’s bodies took place in the region and beyond. The piece was written in honor of Jina Mahsa Amini, murdered in September 2022 by the religious morality police of Iran's government. 
		<br>
		<br>
The set-up is as follows: The stage is that of a film theater and I am sitting at a desk in front of a computer, facing the audience. The computer’s screen is split into two halves: the left half contains the text I am reading to an audience; and the right contains the desktop version of Instagram, from which I’ll be soon regularly playing short clips. The screen behind me (the same screen onto which the film will be later projected) shows the entirety of my computer screen.
