		<br>Transmission is a space for lengthy video broadcasting and slow viewing. It moves from a place of undisciplined impulses and draws inspiration from contestational and anti-establishment strategies for image making and dissemination. But it really is as simple as just a space were images not too concerned with intelligibility come one after the other for sensible viewing. Sometimes, the broadcasts travel outside of their dedicated online space for augmented viewing experiences.
